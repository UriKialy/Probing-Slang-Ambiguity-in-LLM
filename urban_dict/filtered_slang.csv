3) Malon: A young farm girl Link meets and befriends in Ocarina of Time

4) Princess Ruto: The princess of the Zora's (fish people) who Link supposedly was going to marry in Ocarina of Time

5) Tetra: The captain of a pirate ship, that started Link's adventure in Wind Waker, was really Zelda but she didn't know who she really was when she met Link

6)Medii: A Rito girl (bird people) who Link meets in Wind Waker, might not be a loving relationship, just a friendly one

7)Ilia: Link's childhood friend from Twilight Princess, her being kidnapped starts his quest in the first place.

8)Midna: The princess of the Twilight Realm who replaces Navi as a companion and advice giver, though she is much less annoying.  Midna originally planned to use Link as a minion but eventually fell in love with him, awwwwww.  Also, Link really loved Midna back, when it is usually the girl just falling for Link, Midna counts as 2 girls because when she met Link she was a small imp, but after Ganondorf is defeated she returns to her normal (and very hot) form.
